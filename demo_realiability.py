"""24 · demo_reliability.py — entry point: reliability walkthrough over the
noisy corpus (guardrails, scope filter, memory, semantic cache).

Builds the guarded agent (mixed HR + noise corpus + guarded search tool +
memory + semantic cache + input/output safety guardrail) and walks through
the scenarios that show each piece working:

1. An HR question -> correct, cited answer (retrieval works amid noise)
2. A prompt-injection/jailbreak attempt -> blocked by the input guardrail
   before retrieval even runs
3. A Finance/Sales/Operations/Business question -> polite refusal, not a
   hallucinated answer (scope guardrail)
4. Repeating an earlier HR question -> semantic cache hit (no LLM call)
5. A follow-up that only makes sense with prior context -> correct
   contextual answer (memory)

Run `python ingest.py` first, then: python demo_reliability.py
