"""11 · tools — wrap retrieve (08) + re-rank (10) as one tool the agent calls.

Retriever-as-tool: wide retrieval -> re-rank -> narrow, cited result.

create_guarded_search_tool(): the default — plus the scope guardrail
(category allow-list + post-rerank relevance floor, see config's
HR_POLICY_CATEGORIES / RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD). Every real path uses this.

create_search_tool(): the plain tool — no category filter, no relevance
gate. Kept only for the red-team plain baseline (build_plain_assistant).
