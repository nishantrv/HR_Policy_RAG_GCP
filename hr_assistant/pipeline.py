"""17 · pipeline — wire the components into ready-to-use agents, and the
ask() flow that drives them.

    ask()       input guardrail (13) -> semantic cache (14) -> agent (16)
                -> output guardrail (13) -> cache store.   The default path
                for app.py / main.py / demo_reliability.py.
    ask_plain() raw agent call, none of the above. evaluate.py + the
                red-team plain baseline only.

Ingestion (09) is separate — the builders connect to the Qdrant collection
it already built, and bootstrap it once only on a completely fresh setup.
