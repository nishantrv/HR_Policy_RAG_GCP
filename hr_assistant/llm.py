"""12 · llm — connect to the model.

Every model call in the app goes through one place: get_llm(). It returns a
LangChain chat model backed by a LiteLLM *Router* (the litellm SDK, running
in-process — NOT a separate proxy service):

    primary   -> Vertex AI Gemini  (config.LLM_MODEL_NAME)
    fallback  -> Groq              (config.FALLBACK_MODEL_NAME), used only if
                                    the Vertex call errors after num_retries

The app always asks for one logical model ("hr-llm"); the Router decides
what actually serves it. Adding, swapping, or reordering backends is a
change here and in config.py — never in the calling code (agent.py,
guardrails.py).

Why the SDK and not a hosted proxy: with one app there's nothing a separate
gateway service buys that this doesn't — provider-agnostic calls and
automatic failover both live in the Router. It also removes an entire class
of deployment problem (a second Cloud Run service, its IAM binding, and
minting a Google ID token per request). Vertex auth is plain Application
Default Credentials, exactly as a direct Gemini call would use.
